         <h3>Introduction</h3>
         <aricle>
           <p>
             My name is Kevin Deng, I am Chinese and was born in Canada, I'm currently a grade 11 student at Lilian Osborn High School.
             I like to play the piano and watch YouTube videos during my spare time. I am not a very social person
             but I still like meeting new people with similar interests.

          <h3>Career Plans</h3>
          <article>
            <p>
              In the future I hope I can get into the University of British Columbia in order to study business or economics.
              I am very interested in the stock market and would love to learn more about investments.
              However, I also want to apply to the University of Alberta because I want to live close to my family.
              I may also decide to pursue computer science if I still enjoy it after I graduate from Highschool, but honestly I'm very uncertain about the future.
