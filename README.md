### 50 Word Description
My name is Kevin Deng, I am Chinese and was born in Canada, I'm currently a grade 11 student at Lilian Osborn High School. I like to play the piano and watch YouTube videos during my spare time. I am not a very social person but I still like meeting new people with similar interests.

### 50-word Career Description
In the future I hope I can get into the University of British Columbia in order to study business or economics.
I am very interested in the stock market and would love to learn more about investments.
However, I also want to apply to the University of Alberta because I want to live close to my family.
I may also decide to pursue computer science if I still enjoy it after I graduate from Highschool, but honestly I'm very uncertain about the future.
